# Fnaming-cplusplus
 This is the way, I use for naming in c++! This is **not standard**.
 # Files
 I name files with **not capital** letters, and **-** between names with several parts.
 > my_file_name
 # Class
 Class name start with **capital** letter, and for a class with multipart name write first letter of each parts with a **capital** letter.
 > MyClassName
